    <h1>Energy units:  <br />kW or kWh?</h1>

    <h2>Kilowatt-hours (kWh)</h3>

    <p>
      Measure <em>how much</em> energy has been used (or generated, or stored). Use them to talk about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The amount of energy generated by your solar array in a day</li>
      <li>The size of a home storage battery, or EV battery</li>
      <li>Your daily household consumption of electricity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Kilowatt-hours are the units of electricity that you pay your energy supplier for.
    </p>

    <h2>Kilowatts (kW)</h3>

    <p>
      Measure <em>how fast</em> energy is used (or generated, or stored) at a single point in time. Use them to talk about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How much electricity is being generated by your solar array right now</li>
      <li>How much electricity a particular appliance is using right now</li>
      <li>The rate at which a battery can charge or discharge</li>
      <li>The size of your solar array in perfect conditions (&ldquo;kilowatts-peak&rdquo; or &ldquo;kWp&rdquo;)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Kilowatts are a measure of <em>power</em>, or how quickly energy is
      being transferred from one place to another.
    </p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3>
      What's a good way to remember this?
    </h3>
    <p>
      With practice, using the right units will become second nature. In the meantime,
      try this mnemonic:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        kW<strong>h</strong>: the <strong>h</strong> means <strong>how much</strong>,
        because it's measuring a <strong>quantity</strong> of energy.
      </li>
      <li>
        k<strong>W</strong>: the <strong>W</strong> means <strong>when</strong>,
        because it's measuring a <strong>rate</strong> of energy transfer.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Why does this matter?
    </h3>
    <p>
      A lot of people (even professional electricians!) use kilowatts and kilowatt-hours
      interchangeably. This is a bad thing for a couple of reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, it's just universally important to be correct, precise and consistent when
      communicating about any technological or scientific topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mixing up kilowatts and kilowatt-hours is exactly equivalent to saying &ldquo;I drove
      to work, a distance of five miles per hour from my house, at an average speed of
      30 miles&rdquo;. It makes no sense at all, it's deeply confusing, and it hinders
      accurate communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, it has real-world consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      An apocryphal example: recently, a solar farm was
      proposed with a generation capacity of 500 megawatts (which is reasonable large,
      but not unheard of), and also some onsite battery storage, the capacity of which
      was not specified in the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the local community
      misinterpreted the proposal, incorrectly believing that the onsite battery storage
      capacity would be 500 megawatt-hours, which would make it comfortably the largest
      such facility in Europe. This misunderstanding created widespread uproar and
      vicious opposition to the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistake was caused, at least in part, by confusion about the units of measurement. To
      reuse the previous metaphor, it's the difference between designing a car that is
      able to travel 500 miles, and a car that is able to travel at 500 miles per hour!
    </p>
    <p>
      The ultimate loser here, of course, is the climate. If we can't communicate effectively
      regarding proposals and plans to generate clean energy (or reduce energy demand), then
      we risk delaying projects that are critical to our decarbonisation efforts.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Isn't this elitism?
    </h3>
    <p>
      No. Anyone who understands the difference between the speed of a car and the
      distance travelled by the car, or between the rate that water comes out of a tap
      and the volume of water in a bucket, can easily understand the difference between
      kilowatts and kilowatt-hours.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Why do so many people get this wrong?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I think it's because &ldquo;kilowatt-hours&rdquo; (kWh) sounds tantalisingly similar to
      &ldquo;miles per hour&rdquo; (mph). So it's tempting to think that, if kilowatt-hours
      are like miles per hour (a measure of speed) then kilowatts must be like
      miles (a measure of quantity). But this is exactly backwards! Kilowatts
      measure the rate of energy transfer, and so they already have the &ldquo;per hour&rdquo;
      part built in. One kilowatt-hour doesn't mean &ldquo;one kilowatt per hour&rdquo;, it means
      one kilowatt <em>for an hour</em>. It's equivalent to saying &ldquo;one mile per hour,
      for one hour&rdquo; - or one mile!
    </p>
    <h3>
      Why use kilowatts (and kilowatt-hours) for your examples, and not watts, or
      megawatts, or gigawatts?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Kilowatts (and kilowatt-hours) are the scale at which this problem usually
      manifests, because the confusion usually exists in conversations about domestic
      energy: rooftop solar, home batteries, heat pumps, energy bills etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      People working with megawatts or gigawatts (in other words, utility-scale energy)
      usually have sufficient experience or academic background to use the correct units.
      If you disagree, feel free to substitute &ldquo;kilo&rdquo; with any other prefix (or none
      at all) everywhere above.
